# Example: Simple Brainstorm

This example shows a basic roundtable session for brainstorming feature ideas.

## Scenario

You want to brainstorm new features for a note-taking app.

## Command

```bash
/s2s:roundtable:start "New features for note-taking app" --strategy disney
```

## Session Flow

Roundtable Session Started
═══════════════════════════

Session: 20241230-143000-new-features-note-taking
Topic: New features for note-taking app
Strategy: disney
Participants: product-manager, software-architect, technical-lead, devops-engineer
Workflow: brainstorm

Starting discussion...
```

### 2. Dreamer Phase

**Facilitator Question**:
> Think BIG. What features would make this the best note-taking app ever? No constraints - what would delight users?

**Product Manager**:
> - AI-powered writing assistant that helps complete thoughts
> - Seamless sync across all devices with offline support
> - Voice-to-text that understands context and formatting
> Confidence: 0.9

**Software Architect**:
> - Real-time collaboration like Google Docs
> - Plugin system for extensibility
> - Knowledge graph connecting related notes automatically
> Confidence: 0.85

**Technical Lead**:
> - Version history with diff view
> - End-to-end encryption with zero-knowledge architecture
> - API for third-party integrations
> Confidence: 0.8

**DevOps Engineer**:
> - Self-hosted option for privacy-conscious users
> - Multi-region deployment for low latency
> - Automatic backup to user's cloud storage
> Confidence: 0.75

**Facilitator Synthesis**:
> Dreamer phase identified 12 feature ideas across 4 categories:
> - AI/Automation: writing assistant, voice-to-text, knowledge graph
> - Collaboration: real-time editing, sharing
> - Security: E2E encryption, self-hosted option
> - Platform: offline sync, plugins, API, version history

### 3. Realist Phase

**Facilitator Question**:
> Given these ideas, which are feasible for MVP? What would implementation look like?

**Responses** focus on practical evaluation...

**Synthesis**:
> MVP candidates (consensus):
> - Offline sync (must-have)
> - Version history (straightforward)
> - API basics (enables future features)
>
> Post-MVP:
> - Real-time collaboration (complex)
> - AI features (require ML infrastructure)
> - E2E encryption (security audit needed)

### 4. Critic Phase

**Facilitator Question**:
> What could go wrong with our MVP plan? What risks should we address?

**Responses** identify risks...

**Synthesis**:
> Key risks identified:
> - Offline sync conflict resolution is tricky
> - API versioning strategy needed upfront
> - Version history storage could grow large
>
> Mitigations proposed:
> - Use CRDT for conflict-free sync
> - Start with URL versioning for API
> - Implement pruning for old versions

════════════════════

Session: 20241230-143000-new-features-note-taking
Topic: New features for note-taking app
Strategy: disney
Phases: 3 (dreamer, realist, critic)
Total rounds: 3

Consensus Reached:
- MVP: Offline sync, version history, basic API
- Use CRDT for conflict resolution
- URL versioning for API
- Implement version pruning

Unresolved (noted for follow-up):
- Specific AI feature to prioritize post-MVP

Output: .s2s/sessions/20241230-143000-new-features-note-taking-summary.md

Next steps:
- Create implementation plans for MVP features
- Schedule follow-up session for AI feature discussion
```

# Brainstorm Summary: New Features for Note-Taking App

**Session**: 20241230-143000-new-features-note-taking
**Strategy**: Disney (Dreamer → Realist → Critic)
**Participants**: product-manager, software-architect, technical-lead, devops-engineer

## Dreamer Ideas

- AI-powered writing assistant
- Real-time collaboration
- Knowledge graph
- Voice-to-text
- Plugin system
- E2E encryption
- Self-hosted option
- Offline sync
- Version history
- API

## Realist Evaluation

### MVP (Feasible Now)
1. **Offline sync** - Use CRDT for conflict resolution
2. **Version history** - With pruning for storage management
3. **Basic API** - URL versioning from start

### Post-MVP
- Real-time collaboration (complex infrastructure)
- AI features (ML platform needed)
- E2E encryption (security audit required)

## Critic Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Sync conflicts | CRDT implementation |
| API compatibility | URL versioning strategy |
| Storage growth | Version pruning |

## Next Steps

1. Create implementation plans for MVP features
2. Schedule architecture session for CRDT design
3. Follow-up brainstorm for AI feature prioritization
